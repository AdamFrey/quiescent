# Quiescent

A lightweight ClojureScript abstraction over ReactJS, emphasizing its
ability to (re)render immutable values efficiently.

An obligatory [TodoMVC implementation](https://github.com/levand/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/architecture-examples/quiescent) is available.

See the [documentation](docs.md) for instructions and examples of how
to use Quiescent.

Quiescent is still alpha/experiental software, use at your own risk,
etc.

## Rationale

ReactJS is an extremely interesting approach to UI rendering for
HTML-based web applications. Its core value proposition is to make it
possible to write one set of UI rendering code that works for both
initial creation, and any future updates. Updates are extremely
efficient, because only the minimal set of necessary deltas are
actually sent to the DOM.

In other words, React lets you write your UI code *once*, and still
have a dynamic, data-driven application. Ideally, it eliminates any
need to write explicit UI manipulation code. Instead, you are
responsible only for supplying a specification of what the UI should
look like, given certain data. The ReactJS implementation takes care
of all the details of how to morph the existing DOM to correspond to
changes in the input data.

Quiescent is intended to expose this feature and *only* this feature
in a way that is convenient and idiomatic to ClojureScript, while
remaining highly efficient.

It has the following design goals:

* **single concern:** Quiescent is designed to do one thing: render and
   re-render HTML from immutable values. It does not attempt to
   participate in state management, inform how you organize your
   application, or force the use of any specific technique for
   managing state updates. Feel free to use atoms, watchers,
   core.async, compilation-based models, message-passing, etc. The
   only requierment is that values passed to Quiescent components are
   immutable value types.
* **avoid OO idioms:** ReactJS is itself highly object-oriented, with
   stateful objects that may implement a variety of
   behaviors. Quiescent provides a purely functional interface,
   allowing users to construct a ReactJS component tree using only the
   basic tools of functional programming: function definition and
   composition.
* **top-down rendering:** All renders and updates are initiated by
   instructing Quiescent to render a particular value to a particular
   location in the DOM. Individual tree components do not maintain
   their own state and do not re-render themselves unless explicitly
   directed to do so.

   This is intended to emulate classical 'rendering' semantics for 2D
   or 3D bitmapped applications, where the entirety of a scene is
   re-drawn from scratch for every frame. Of course, React/Quiescent
   does not actually do this, for performance reasons, but the fact
   that it does not is an implementation detail; the conceptual model
   is the same.
* **leverage immutability:** By assuming that any value provided to a
   rendered component is immutable, Quiescent can prevent ReactJS from
   even calculating if it needs to render sub-trees that have not
   changed from the last time the application was updated. Since
   equality checks are highly efficient in ClojureScript, large
   application structures can be re-rendered frequently with almost no
   performance hit apart from that necessary to re-render leaf nodes
   that actually did change.
* **compatibility:** Although you will hopefully be able to write the
   vast majority of your application using Quiescent's model, if
   absolutely necessary, you can always fall back and use a raw
   ReactJS component (or, for that matter, a ReactJS component
   constructed using another ClojureScript interface.) This is
   possible at any level of the rendering component tree.

Thee goals differ slightly from other ClojureScript interfaces to
React, as described below.

### Comparison with Om

[Om](http://github.com/swannodette/om) is another ClojureScript
interface to ReactJS, highly capable and well-designed. It provides
categorically more features than Quiescent, at the cost of taking more
control and specifying more rigidly the way application state is
modeled, updated and re-rendered.

The most important conceptual distinctions are:

* To create an Om component you must implement a protocol; due to its
  relative lack of capability, Quiescent only requires components to
  provide a single render function.
* Om controls the primary application state atom and how it is
  updated. In Quiescent this is entirely the responsibility of the
  consumer.
* Om explicitly allows components to maintain local state, while
  Quiescent forbids this. In my opinion the benefits of requiring
  components to account for local state do not justify the pervasive
  cost to implementation.

  Specifically, addressing the two reasons David Nolen gives for allowing
  application state:

  1. _"Local state pollutes application data."_ An alternative view is
  that all data is application data, whether it is transient or
  persistent, important or insignificant, wherever it is actually
  located. There is little harm in including it in the top-level data
  structure, and if your application does demand a hierarchy of data
  (persistent vs. transient, etc) for different purposes, it is better
  to model that relationship explicitly rather than leaving transient
  data tucked invisibly away in component state.

  2. _"Local state is always up-to-date."_ This is not relevant in
  Quiescent's render model because Quiescent does not manage state.

* Om components are always aware of their location in the primary
  application state, via a _cursor_ (a hybrid of functional zippers
  and lenses). Quiescent components are not. This means that Om
  components can dispatch updates to "themselves", wheras a DOM event
  handler function attached to a Quiescent component can only effect
  change by reaching back and doing something to the top-level
  application state (e.g by sending a core.async message, swapping the
  top-level atom, etc).

  This does, somewhat, negate the concept of component modularity;
  Quiescent's contention is that the benefit of top-down value-based
  rendering exceeds that of truly modular components.

Ultimately, though, Om is an excellent, well-thought-out library and
if your needs or design goals more closely align with its capabilities
than with Quiescent, you should absolutely use it.

### Comparison with Reagent

[Reagent](http://holmsand.github.io/reagent/) is another ClojureScript
wrapper for ReactJS. It is, perhaps, *easier* than either Om or
Quiescent and certainly the most readable of the three.

The key differences between Reagent and Quiescent (or Om, for that
matter) are:

* Reagent defaults to a
  [hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup)-like syntax for
  component definitions.
* Reagent handles updates via a special version of an atom (a
  *reactive atom* or *ratom*). Whenver a component references a ratom,
  watches are established such that the component will re-render when
  the value of the ratom changes. As such, Reagent components are not
  driven by top-down data or a singular application state, but by
  whatever ratoms are referenced in their definition.
* Reagent, like Om, maintains full control of the render/re-render cycle.

Although I do not have as much first-hand experience with Reagent, it
seems to be a very convenient approach and if it meets your needs you
should definitly give it a try.

### Implementation

This section presumes familarity with how ReactJS works.

In short, basic Quiescent components implement only two of ReactJS's
component lifecycle events:

1. _shouldComponentUpdate_ is always predicated exclusively on whether
the immutable value passed to the component constructor function has
changed. If so, the component re-renders. If not, it doesn't.

2. The implementation of _render_ is provided as a function supplied
by the user. The output of this render function is presumed to be a
single ReactJS component, as it is in vanilla ReactJS. The function,
however, is passed the immutable value that was used to construct the
function. It is also passed any additional arguments that were
provided to the component constructor.

## Future Plans

* I would like to create a set of benchmarks comparing Quiescent's
  performance with Om, vanilla ReactJS and possibly other JavaScript
  MVC toolkits.

* I have some ideas around creating a common protocol for obtaining
  ReactJS components that would make it much easier to provide
  alternative implementations and syntaxes for component defintions
  (e.g, ERB, Yaml, Hiccup, Enlive, etc). There is a lot of potential
  to suit the actual syntax used to define components to the
  developers (or designers!) tasked with designing the structure of
  the DOM.

  This could easily be rolled in as a part of Quiescent (and possibly
  adopted by other ReactJS-based libraries as well.
